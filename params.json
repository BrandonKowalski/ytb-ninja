We already do this during standup!\r\n\r\nI know. Who on the team takes notes during standup. Even if you answered yes are they good notes? \r\n\r\nYTB eliminates this hassle by having the statuses delivered straight from the horse's mouth. No mishearing, transcribing issues, etc.\r\n\r\n>I already have a spreadsheet. On Google Docs even! This is stupid.\r\n\r\nOh really? Does you Google docs email stakeholders or place blockers in a prominent position? Nope. Didn't think so. I know it does require you to upkeep it manually. That's gross. We have enough to do.\r\n\r\n>Hmmm. This all all really compelling. Where can I try this?\r\n\r\nJust go here -> https://ytb.ninja\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
